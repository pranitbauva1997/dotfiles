# My Dotfiles

This is a repository to store all my dotfiles and configurations so that
I can setup my Linux machine will relative ease after a new install.
I also have a few of my custom scripts which I use for my daily purposes
which I will include here. There would also be some notes to refer to
those specific scripts/configurations so as to provide me a handy
reference at times when I am forgetful.

**Note:** Dotfiles are like underwear, everyone should have their own.
